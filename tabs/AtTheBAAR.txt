[verse 1]
      D                                    G                        D                           A
I got paged at 3 this morning. Jolted from sleep without warning. I felt like I'd been hit by a car.
            D                                 G                          D             A           D
But there's no more time for rest. Got to log on and do my best. There's time to sleep *after* the BAAR.

[chorus]
       G            D                                          A
At the BAAR, at the BAAR. Time to look around and see where we are.
       D              D7               G                Em            D          A           D
We can learn from our mistakes and see what improvement takes. That's why we all come to the BAAR.

[verse 2]
          D                               G                              D                           A
I've been at this thing all night, but it still isn't quite right. These batches are running slow as tar.
         D                          G                            D                A                D
Now I've got an empty belly, and my office chair is smelly. Good thing no one can smell you at the BAAR.

[chorus]
       G            D                                          A
At the BAAR, at the BAAR. Time to look around and see where we are.

What's that smoke off in the distance? Is it a melting compute instance? I can't tell what it is from this far.
        D                           G                               D             A          D
Is it a glorious funeral pyre, or a smoldering dumpster fire? We'll get it sorted out at the BAAR.

[chorus]
       G            D                                          A
At the BAAR, at the BAAR. Time to look around and see where we are.

We can handle any case, or incident that we might face. If you think we're exaggerating, we are.
          D                                       G                               D            A              D
Though my command line chops are strong, they can sometimes turn out wrong. Let's talk about a runbook at the BAAR.

[chorus]
       G            D                                          A

I keep dealing with this crap, and I just want to take a nap. This is my most exhausted by far.
        D                                G                                 D               A               D
Crack a monster and pour it in, now I've got my second wind!  And now it's gone, could you carry me to the BAAR?

[chorus]
       G            D                                          A

Once I've found my happy place, that's when it blows up in my face. At least I think that's how I got this scar.
      D                                G                               D             A              D
Every bug is an adventure, though my reaction should be censored. I'll tell you all about it at the BAAR.

[final chorus]
       G            D                                                  A
At the BAAR, at the BAAR. If you look around, you'll see we've come so far.
