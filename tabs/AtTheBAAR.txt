[verse 1]
      D                                    G                     
I got paged at 3 this morning. Jolted from sleep without warning.
  D                           A
I felt like I'd been hit by a car.
            D                                 G                 
But there's no more time for rest. Got to log on and do my best.
        D             A         D
There's time to sleep after the BAAR.


[chorus]
       G            D    
At the BAAR, at the BAAR.
                                     A
Time to look around and see where we are.
       D              D7               G                Em    
We can learn from our mistakes and see what improvement takes.
       D          A           D
That's why we all come to the BAAR.


[verse 2]
          D                               G                       
I've been at this thing all night, but it still isn't quite right.
      D                           A
These batches are running slow as tar.
         D                          G                      
Now I've got an empty belly, and my office chair is smelly.
     D                A                D
Good thing no one can smell you at the BAAR.


[chorus]
       G            D    
At the BAAR, at the BAAR.
                                     A
Time to look around and see where we are.
       D              D7               G                Em    
We can learn from our mistakes and see what improvement takes.
       D          A           D
That's why we all come to the BAAR.


[verse 3]
            D                                  G                        
What's that smoke off in the distance? Is it a melting compute instance?
  D                               A
I can't tell what it is from this far.
        D                           G
Is it a glorious funeral pyre, or a smoldering dumpster fire?
      D             A          D
We'll get it sorted out at the BAAR.


[chorus]
       G            D    
At the BAAR, at the BAAR.
                                     A
Time to look around and see where we are.
       D              D7               G                Em    
We can learn from our mistakes and see what improvement takes.
       D          A           D
That's why we all come to the BAAR.


[verse 4]
       D                       G
We can handle any case, or incident that we might face.
       D                            A
If you think we're exaggerating, we are.
          D                                       G
Though my command line chops are strong, they can sometimes turn out wrong.
      D            A              D
Let's talk about a runbook at the BAAR.


[chorus]
       G            D    
At the BAAR, at the BAAR.
                                     A
Time to look around and see where we are.
       D              D7               G                Em    
We can learn from our mistakes and see what improvement takes.
       D          A           D
That's why we all come to the BAAR.


[verse 5]
       D                                  G
I keep dealing with this crap, and I just want to take a nap.
     D                       A
This is my most exhausted by far.
        D                                G
Crack a monster and pour it in, now I've got my second wind!
             D               A               D
And now it's gone, could you carry me to the BAAR?


[chorus]
       G            D    
At the BAAR, at the BAAR.
                                     A
Time to look around and see where we are.
       D              D7               G                Em    
We can learn from our mistakes and see what improvement takes.

That's why we all come to the BAAR.


[verse 6]
          D                                    G
Once I've found my happy place, that's when it blows up in my face.
   D                                   A
At least I think that's how I got this scar.
      D                                G
Every bug is an adventure, though my reaction should be censored.
     D             A              D
I'll tell you all about it at the BAAR.


[final chorus]
       G            D    
At the BAAR, at the BAAR.
                                             A
If you look around, you'll see we've come so far.
       D              D7               G                Em    
We can learn from our mistakes and see what improvement takes.
       D          A           D
That's why we all come to the BAAR.
